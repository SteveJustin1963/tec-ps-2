reading the ps/2 mouse

Sure, here's a high-level assembly language example of how you might implement the PS/2 mouse driver routine:

```assembly
; Define I/O ports and buffer sizes
.equ DATA_PORT, 0x00 ; Replace with actual PS/2 data port address
.equ CLOCK_PORT, 0x01 ; Replace with actual PS/2 clock port address
.equ SEGMENT_DISPLAY_PORT, 0x02 ; Replace with actual 7-segment display port address
.equ X_BUFFER_SIZE, 256
.equ Y_BUFFER_SIZE, 256
.equ BUTTON_BUFFER_SIZE, 256

.org 0x0000 ; Program origin

; Buffers for X, Y coordinates, and button states
x_buffer: .ds X_BUFFER_SIZE
y_buffer: .ds Y_BUFFER_SIZE
button_buffer: .ds BUTTON_BUFFER_SIZE

; Main program starts here
start:
  ; Initialization
  ; Set up I/O ports
  
  ; Enter reading loop
read_loop:
  ; Read X coordinate
  call read_ps2_data
  ; Store X coordinate in buffer
  
  ; Read Y coordinate
  call read_ps2_data
  ; Store Y coordinate in buffer
  
  ; Read button state
  call read_ps2_data
  ; Store button state in buffer
  
  ; Update display
  call update_display
  
  jp read_loop ; Continue reading indefinitely

; Subroutine to read data from PS/2 mouse
read_ps2_data:
  ld b, 8 ; 8 bits per byte
  ld hl, 0 ; Initialize data byte
read_bit_loop:
  ; Wait for clock low
  call wait_clock_low
  ; Read data bit
  in a, (DATA_PORT)
  rla ; Rotate left, carry contains data bit
  rl (hl) ; Rotate left, store data bit in data byte
  ; Wait for clock high
  call wait_clock_high
  djnz read_bit_loop ; Continue reading until all 8 bits are read
  ret

; Subroutine to wait for clock low
wait_clock_low:
  in a, (CLOCK_PORT)
  bit 0, a ; Check if clock is low
  jp nz, wait_clock_low ; Loop until clock is low
  ret

; Subroutine to wait for clock high
wait_clock_high:
  in a, (CLOCK_PORT)
  bit 0, a ; Check if clock is high
  jp z, wait_clock_high ; Loop until clock is high
  ret

; Subroutine to update the 7-segment display
update_display:
  ; Convert X, Y coordinates and button states to display format
  ; Send data to the display port
  ret

; Other subroutines (if needed)
```

This code outlines the structure of a PS/2 mouse driver routine in Z80 assembly. It includes initialization, a reading loop, bit-banging routine to read data from the PS/2 mouse, and a subroutine to update the 7-segment display with the buffered data. You'll need to replace placeholders with actual addresses and implement the details of each subroutine according to your hardware setup and the PS/2 protocol specifications. Additionally, you may need to adjust timing and error handling based on the specific requirements of your system.
